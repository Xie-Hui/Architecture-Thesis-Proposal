## Thesis

The traditional developer-lead high-density condo development mode will inevitably lead to creating more and more homogeneous (as a result of commoditization), community-less and unaffordable housing (high development cost and high rate of investment). As an alternative approach, a bottom-up, self-organized development mode will create condos that are more customized, livable and affordable. 

## Antithesis

Because the fundamental goal for tradition developer-lead high-density condo development is to maximize the profit for the developer, the design of the condos is treated more as commodity rather than living spaces for the actual users. This commoditization will inevitablly lead to more homogeneous spatial configuration (to increase the market liquidity and decrease the design cost) which is hard to give way to higher level of customizations for individual users and community-driven development.
